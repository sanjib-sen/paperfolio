## Vaccination

### FAQs

1. I filled up the form and that time I didn't have a NID number. I got my NID number recently. Am I eligible to register on [surokkha.gov.bd](http://surokkha.gov.bd/)?
   Answer: Please go to the form link and click "edit your response" and provide your correct NID. Form link: <https://forms.gle/1UU7mPfsJLeZrfru5>
   We will send the latest NID list to the Health Ministry and it will take some time to process. We will inform you soon when to register in [surokkha.com](http://surokkha.com/).
2. I don't have a NID number, what can I do for vaccination?
   Answer:
   Without an NID number you cannot register in [surokkha.com](http://surokkha.com/). First, apply for NID and after getting it share the NID number using the [link here](https://forms.gle/1UU7mPfsJLeZrfru5)
3. I have edited or have given my NID number using another email address. Am I eligible to register on [surokkha.com](http://surokkha.com/) immediately?
   Answer: No. Only when the university shares the NID number with Health Ministry only then you are able to register in [surokkha.com](http://surokkha.com/). So please wait for some days. We will inform you when to register.
4. I have provided my NID before 29 June. Why did I fail to register on [Surokkha.gov.bd](http://surokkha.gov.bd/)?
   Answer:
   You must use the same date of birth and NID number that you shared with us to register on [surokkha.com](http://surokkha.com/). You may wait for some hours/days and try later. If again failed please email at: [maksudur@bracu.ac.bd](mailto:maksudur@bracu.ac.bd)
5. I have completed my degree. Am I eligible to register on [surokkha.gov.bd](http://surokkha.gov.bd/)?
